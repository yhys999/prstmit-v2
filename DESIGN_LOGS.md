# Prstmit 2.0 Design Strategy

## 1. Visual Identity (视觉识别)
- **Primary Color**: #00D991 (Neon Emerald) - Represents wealth, growth, and trust in FinTech.
- **Background**: #05080A (Rich Black) - Provides a premium, high-security feel.
- **Typography**: Plus Jakarta Sans - Modern, highly readable, and professional.

## 2. Interaction Improvements (交互提升)
- **Compact Calculator**: Placed prominently in the Hero section for immediate conversion.
- **Instant Visual Feedback**: Used `animate-ping` for the "Live" status to create a sense of real-time data.
- **Micro-interactions**: Added hover scaling and glow effects to call-to-action buttons.

## 3. Cultural Representation (文化融合)
- **Injected Imagery**: Specifically selected high-quality African portrait placeholders from Unsplash to build immediate rapport with the target market (Nigeria).
- **Social Proof**: Enhanced the testimonial display with profile-based UI instead of plain text.

## 4. Next Steps (后续建议)
- **Mobile Experience**: Ensure the calculator card stacks cleanly on mobile.
- **Trust Badges**: Add PCI/DSS and Central Bank symbols to the footer.
- **Speed**: Use Next.js for SSR to ensure the rates load instantly.
